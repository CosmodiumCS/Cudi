# Cudi v1
Discord bot we built to run and compile code on our team VPS

## Usage
See the help menu by simply using `!c help`.

## Setting up yourself
Should you want to use the code yourself, you need only replace the Discord token in `main.py`, and generate an invite link of your own. And run the bot in a folder on your VPS

> WARNING: This token controls your entire bot. **It is very important you keep it hidden.**

#### Discord Developer 
You will also need to make your own [discord developer](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) account to aquire said token.

#### Invite Link
You will need to make an invite link in your discord developer portal.
